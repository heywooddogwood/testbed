## Building and Testing

In order to build and test the website, you need
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), specifically the `npm` command. If you need to
install Node.js, use your operating systemâ€™s package manager or visit
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions.

The first time you check out these files, run:

```
npm install
```

Once that has been done, you can build the website with:

```
npm run dist
```

To test the website locally, run the above and then:

```
npx http-server dist
```

You can then visit the URL printed out by the program to test out the web app
in your browser.
